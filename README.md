I am a Frontend Software Engineer with over a decade of experience. I especially enjoy Design Systems, Frontend Infrastructure, and Design Engineering work. Throughout my career, I've been drawn toward problem solving around User Experience (UX) and Developer Experience (DX). When I'm not making the web a better place, I enjoy strolling my dog, gardening, and skiing.
